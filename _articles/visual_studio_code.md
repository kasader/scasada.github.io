I used Visual Studio Code for the very first time today. I found that it is as good as people seem to make it out to be. I don't think that you should always be a regligious freetard all the time like I have been for a very long time. I really like the idea of vim and the idea of emacs, and so on, but at the end of the day, the genuine intuitiveness of Visual Studio Code really manages to shine on its own, and it is quite impressive. I really enjoy Linux, but I have come to discover that there are things that I also dislike about Linux almost as much as I love it, well, at least on Arch. One of these things is package management. I am not sure how things are on different distributions, but after a signifigant period of use, my machine feels like it is crusted out with a bunch of bogus software and so on that I never ever plan to use for any reason again ever. The only solution to this that I see making sense is doing something along the lines of, for each set of projects on enviornements that I plan to experiment with, to virtualize and entire machine and install those tools onto a specialized system that you can use on like a VM or something. Every time I install a package or something, I feel like I am wasting a lot of space on my harddrive, and filling up my computer with things  that I absolutely do not need. I think one day I would like to have a desktop with a couple of TB harddrives that each hold onto different things. Like perhaps I could have a system that is used for gaming on a drive that is reserved for only gaming. I will install my vidya onto there and nothing else. No files that I really need out of there. I mean, I can also share drives and so on. Hold on, scratch that. I would like to have a single drive that I use for gaming, and that would be pretty cool. I like it when ther are things that are organized very neatly and almost as they are perfect in a sense. A little nonsense, I have no idea. The point is that I would like each and every thing to have its own place. 1) A drive for games. 2) A drive for media. 3) A drive for editing. 4) A drive for my virtual machines. 5) A drive for everything else (?).

Microsoft needs to give themselves a pat on the back for their work on Visual Code. I am sure they know how good of a job that they have done on their flagship code editor (RIP Atom), but for a freetard llike myself who has mainly been using Vim and Doom Emacs, it is a huge deal that they have been able to achieve what they have. I know that it has literally only been a single day of me using VSCode, but already, I feel like the proccess of programming has become far more streamlined. It is no longer a question of "how exactly do I have to make this work" and a long and tedious setup which barely works because I don't even know my own needs as a programmer yet. I think that tools like vim are great for text editing, but they are not a, uhhhh, code editing enviornment or what ever those things are called. They are not those things because they are fundamentally first just a text editor. They are damn good for text editing, but I think that they are missing a lot of the features that make something all encompassing right out of the box. It is great for the high degree of customizeability of it, but at they end of the day, unless you already know your specific needs, you will end up creating more problems for yourself than solutions. I would like to come up with an anecdote about my time that I was using Vim with nedtree and I just kept forgetting all the commands and keybinds. Because I did not know my workflow, it was impossible to remember anything relevant to the process of setting up my enviornment each time I wanted to make it work. This is why I have been enjoying VSCode so much, if I forget what I need, there is a very simple context menu that I can just click on and the tool I need will appear in my hands and it will not interrupt my workflow, which is a beautiful thing. The computers should serve us, of course, but something I just want to interface with my text editor without a page of shortcuts infront of my face at all times. I do not want to sound like a little soyjak soydev soylent drinker sad little baby man who needs help at every step of the way, but for now I am defining this era of my life by what is enjoyable to me. By admitting this digitial defeat to my closed-source eugenist evil overlords over at Microsoft and do my little bow of shame I think that I will be able to mature as a developer and one day rise to defeat my demons and reclaim what is mine (using vim like a super chazz). The world has become very complicated, at least when it comes to development and that sort of thing, so I think it is appropriate to have a tool which does a lot of the thinking for me. I am trying to learn what React is right now.
